# Saafi DevOps Platform

Saafi is a developer-first, self-service DevOps platform for fast, secure, multi-cloud infrastructure provisioning (AWS & GCP) with GitHub integration. It empowers teams to provision, manage, and track cloud environments and blueprints with ease, enabling modern DevOps workflows and automation.

## üöÄ Vision
Saafi aims to make cloud infrastructure as easy and safe as possible for developers and teams. Our vision is to:
- Enable anyone to provision secure, compliant, and cost-effective cloud environments in minutes.
- Automate environment lifecycle for every developer, pull request, and team.
- Provide deep GitHub integration for seamless CI/CD and environment management.
- Support multi-cloud (AWS, GCP) and compliance out-of-the-box.

## ‚ú® What Makes Saafi Stand Out
- **Self-service, developer-first UX**: No more waiting for ops‚Äîprovision what you need, when you need it.
- **Blueprint marketplace**: Reusable, versioned infrastructure templates for common stacks and compliance needs.
- **GitHub integration**: PR-triggered environments, feedback, and automation.
- **Multi-cloud support**: AWS and GCP from day one.
- **Security & compliance**: RBAC, secrets management, and compliance tagging built-in.
- **Cost and usage tracking**: See what you‚Äôre running and what it costs.
